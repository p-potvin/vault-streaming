"""Lazy ASR model access.

Two rules matter here and both come from the live-subs daemon, which is the
best-behaved torch process in the stack:

1. **Never import torch/NeMo until transcription is actually requested.** The
   monolith imported the Parakeet wrapper at module scope, so *every* action paid
   the multi-second import even when it only needed ffmpeg. Splitting the scripts
   is pointless if the import cost is unconditional.
2. **Load the model once per process and release it deterministically.** Batch
   runs reuse a single instance; :func:`release` drops the reference and hands
   the memory back so RAM does not creep across a long queue.

The wrapper lives in a differently-named package in each repo, so we probe.
